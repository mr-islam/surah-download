# surah-downloader
EDIT: quranicaudio.com is kind enough to provide torrents for all of their audio. Please use those, and not this downloader that will use their bandwidth.

Mass download your favorite surahs from quranicaudio.com

This was a good project, but I *just* noticed on the website page that they include a torrent link at the very top to download all the audio files -_-

As of now, it is functiional and complete, but I think I will make this and polish this anyway, good way to learn. But don't go to the trouble of using this; the torrent is simpler :)
